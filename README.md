# Build a Multi-Agent System with LangGraph ü¶úüï∏Ô∏è

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to build a multi-agent system using LangGraph. The system is designed to handle complex customer service queries for a digital music store

## System Architecture

The system consists of three specialized subagents:

1. **Customer Information Agent**: Handles customer profile data (name, email, address, etc.)
2. **Music Catalog Agent**: Manages queries about the music store's catalog (albums, tracks, artists)
3. **Invoice Information Agent**: Processes customer purchase history and invoice queries
